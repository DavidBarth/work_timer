* don't allow deletion of clients/projects if event data exists
* limit users to one active event or allow parallel (make an option?)

* indexes on db columns
* testing/handling for:
	* events that overlap midnight <- for now apply hours to start day
  * events that overlap a DST-type change (handled automatically?)

* what about personal projects or projects for small clients with no sub projects? how to make that clean and easy?
